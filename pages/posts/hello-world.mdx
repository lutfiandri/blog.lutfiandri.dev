import Layout from '../../layouts/post'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Markdown/MDX with Next.js',
  author: 'Lee Robinson'
}

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

I **love** *using* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)


```typescript
// naiesrtn
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'
import { ReactNode } from 'react'
import { Image, Header, Text, CodeBlock } from '../components/ui'
import Head from 'next/head'
import { PostMeta } from '../types/meta'
import { Title, Container } from '../components/part/post'

interface ImgProps {
  src: string
  alt: string
}

const components = {
  img: Image,
  h1: Header.H1,
  h2: Header.H2,
  h3: Header.H3,
  h4: Header.H4,
  h5: Header.H5,
  h6: Header.H6,
  p: Text.P,
  em: Text.Em,
  a: Text.A,
  pre: (props: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>) => <div {...props} />,
  code: CodeBlock,
}
```

If you only follow guided resources, you'll wind up in *tutorial hell*. You won't develop the problem-solving skills needed to succeed as a developer. When you try to build your own project, you won't know where to start. It will feel like you've spent so much time practicing without developing any tangible, practical skills.
