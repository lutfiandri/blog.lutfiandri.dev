I **love** *using* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

If you only follow guided resources, you'll wind up in *tutorial hell*. You won't develop the problem-solving skills needed to succeed as a developer. When you try to build your own project, you won't know where to start. It will feel like you've spent so much time practicing without developing any tangible, practical skills.
